#### **2.1.1**

#### **2.1.0**
- Added option ```deepClone``` for ```state.get()``` to return a deepCloned copy of the retrieved state
- Added option for ```getItemIndex``` ```state.get()``` to return the index of an array item

#### **2.0.0**
- changed method name to inject store to ```createHoneyPot```
- Now ```addHoney``` returns ```{ reducer, state }```. State now contains methods on it to ```update, get, and reset```
- updated folder & file structure

#### **1.1.1**
- Bug Fix: fixed issue with wait method being incorrectly exported

#### **1.1.0**

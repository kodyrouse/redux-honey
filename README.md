# Redux-Sugar üç¨
A simple, lightweight, fast plugin that makes it *a lot* sweeter to work with advanced redux ü•∞

# Problems With Plain Redux
In a lot of ways, redux is *fantastic* at what it does! The main issue with redux is all that dreaded *boilerplate*. It makes your files unnecessarily large / complicated, hurts my soul, and much more difficult to maintain! This is where ```redux-sugar``` comes to the rescue üôå

## Benefits To Using Redux-Sugar
- Reduces unnecessary file clutter (AKA the heartwarming *redux boilerplate*)
- No need for top-file action types like **WHY_AM_I_YELLING** or ugly switch case statements
- Built-in abilities to ```resetState``` and ```resetStoreToInitialState```
- Allows for simplier use of async updates with ```wait()```, removing the need for middleware like ```redux-thunk```

# Installation

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```
// With npm
npm i redux-sugar

// Or with yarn
yarn add redux-sugar
```

# Usage

## Initialize
Pass your store into ```sugarcoatStore``` at creation:

```
import { createStore, combineReducers } from "redux";
import { sugarcoatStore } from "redux-sugar";
import funWithReduxSugarReducer from "./funWithReduxSugarReducer";

const combinedReducers = combineReducers({
 funWithReduxSugarReducer
});

const store = createStore(combinedReducers);

// Pass your store into sugarcoatStore to add the magic
sugarcoatStore(store);

export default store;
```

## addSugar(stateKey, initialState)

Call ```addSugar()``` to create a new piece of state

### Arguments
- **stateKey** *(required)* - unique string. The filename / reducer name is recommended for debugging purposes
- **initialState** *(required)* - object that defines the stucture of this piece of your store

### Returns
- **reducer** - *(function)* - never called directly. Export out of the file to pass into *combineReducers()*
- **updateState** - *(function)* - used to update *this* piece of state only
- **getState** - *(function)* - used to get state from *this* piece of state only
- **resetState** - *(function)* - used to reset *this* piece of state back to the original *initialState* that was passed when calling ```addSugar()```

Example:
```
// This is what funWithReduxSugarReducer.js would look like

import { addSugar } from "redux-sugar";

// The initialState for this piece of state
const initialState = {
 loveProgramming: false,
 favPlugin: "redux-sugar"
};

// addSugar() returns an object with its reducer, updateState, getState, and resetState
const { reducer, updateState, getState, resetState } = addSugar("funWithReduxSugar", initialState);
export default reducer;
```

## updateState(payload)

Call ```updateState()``` to update its state

### Arguments
- **payload** *(required)* - object - the object that defines the changes you want to make to your store. You can pass one or more key-value pairs to update your state

### Returns
*null*

Example:

```
import { addSugar } from "redux-sugar";

// The initialState for this file
const initialState = {
 loveProgramming: false,
 favPlugin: "redux-sugar",
 isStateUpdated: false
};

const { reducer, updateState, getState, resetState } = addSugar("funWithReduxSugar", initialState);
export default reducer;

// Called inside a react component
export const updateFavPlugin = (selectedFavPlugin) => {

	// updates state's favPlugin and isStateUpdated
	updateState({ favPlugin: selectedFavPlugin, isStateUpdated: true });
}
```

#### Side Note
As a safety check, you can't pass key-value pairs that didn't exist on the initialState when calling ```updateState()```. This prevents you from accidentally mispelling a key. It also prevents you from going all ü§¨ when you didn't realize you accidentally spelled it ```favPlugim```;

```
// This entire call would fail because isGoingToFailToUpdate was not defined on the initialState
updateState({ favPlugin: "", isGoingToFailToUpdate: true });
```

## getState(keysString, options)

Call ```getState()``` to retrieve what you need from its state. Pass no keysString to get the entire state piece

### Arguments
- **keys** *(optional)* - string - space-separated set of keys. If you want to get the entire state, you don't need to pass anything
- **options** *(optional)* - object - a set of options when calling ```getState()```. Options are defined [here - Link](# Options)

### Returns
- the piece of state that matches the passed keysString

This one is *pretty* neat, so get yo popcorn ready! üçø

Here's an example of how to get a deeply-nested piece of state:

```
// An example state structure
{
 name: "John Smith",
 bodyDetails: {
  height: 185,
  weight: 175,
  athletics: {
   athleticLevel: "somewhat",
   sportingAbilities: {
    isGoodAtFootball: false,
    isGoodAtBaseball: false
   }
  }
 }
}

// If I wanted to get the sportingAbilities array, you pass an in-order list of keys like so:
getState("bodyDetails athletics sportingAbilities");
```

It's *that* simple! üéâ

One of the (many!) cool aspects about ```getState``` is that, by default, it returns a shallow-cloned copy of the original piece of state. Now, you don't need to worry about using spread operators to prevent you from mutating any existing pieces of state - it's already done for you! *(If you want to return the original object or array, checkout [options - Link](# Options)).*


### Options

**returnOriginal** - defaults to `false`. Set to `true` when calling `getState` to return the original, uncloned copy of your state

```
// An example state structure
{
 name: "John Smith",
 bodyDetails: {
  height: 185,
  weight: 175,
  athletics: {
   athleticLevel: "somewhat",
   sportingAbilities: {
    isGoodAtFootball: false,
    isGoodAtBaseball: false
   }
  }
 }
}

// Right now the only option is returnOriginal. More will likely be added in the future!
const options = { returnOriginal: true };

// Returns an uncloned object for sportingAbilities
const sportingAbilities = getState("bodyDetails athletics sportingAbilities", options);
```

## resetState()

### Arguments
*none*

### Returns
*null*

Call ```resetState()``` to set the state piece back to the passed initialState passed.

Example:

```
import { addSugar, wait } from "redux-sugar";



// addSugar() returns an object with its reducer, updateState, getState, and resetState
const { reducer, updateState, getState, resetState } = addSugar("funWithReduxSugar", initialState);
export default reducer;



export const showFunStuffAction = async () => {
	
 // Let components know that . You know, if you're into that stuff. Batteries not included
 updateState({ isFetching: true });

 // wait() is a built-in promise method
 // Waits 500ms before continuing. Described in greater detail below
 await wait(500);

 // Resets this piece of state back to what it was when addSugar() was called
 resetState();
}
```

Super simple!

## wait(duration)

### Arguments
- **duration** *(required)* - integer - the number of ms you want to wait 

### Returns
*null*

Call ```wait()``` when you need to block code execution for a defined duration. An example of it's use is above.


## resetStoreToInitialState()

### Arguments
*none*

### Returns
*null*

Call ```resetStoreToInitialState()``` when you need to reset all states in your store back to its initialState. A usage example would be after a user signs out.

# üçØ Redux-Honey üçØ
A library that makes it *a lot* sweeter to work with advanced redux ü•∞

# Problems With Plain Redux
In a lot of ways, redux is *fantastic* at what it does. The problems begin to arise when your application starts scaling - files become *littered* with unnecessary boilerplate code and your store quickly becomes a complicated mess. It hurts my soul. This is where ```redux-honey``` comes to the rescue üôå

# Benefits To Using Redux-Honey
- Drastically reduces unnecessary file clutter (AKA the heartwarming *redux boilerplate*). You no longer need to hear "reducer" or "action types" again! üéâ
- No need for ```react-redux``` or ```redux-thunk```/```redux-saga``` **(though redux-honey still works with react-redux)**
- Safety checks & warnings to prevent accidental state updates && state-binding for state that doesn't exist
- Built-in methods like ```state.reset()``` and ```resetStoreToInitialState```

# Installation

```js
// With npm
npm i redux-honey

// With yarn
yarn add redux-honey
```

# Initialize
Call ```createHoneyPot``` to initialize your store. Pass in an object of all of your created state pieces

### Arguments
- **combinedState** *(required)* - object - An object that contains all states returned from calling ```addHoney()```

### Returns
- Redux store

```js
import { createHoneyPot, addHoney } from "redux-honey";


// "addHoney" creates a new piece of state that can be added to "createHoneyPot"
const funWithReduxHoney = addHoney("funWithReduxHoney", {
 isFun: true,
 favFood: "pizza"
});

// Calling "createHoneyPot" creates your redux honey store
const store = createHoneyPot({
 funWithReduxHoney
});


// No need to add your store in <Provider /> by default (only if you plan on using the built-in extract() method)
ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
 document.getElementById('root')
)

// If it's a pain to migrate away from react-redux, you can still pass in your store like usual
ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
   <App />
  </Provider>,
 document.getElementById('root')
)
```

By default, ```redux-honey``` comes built-in with a connect-like method called ```extract``` to bind state to react components. This makes it not necessary to use a wrapper component like ```<Provider />```. However, if you still want to use ```react-redux``` & ```connect``` in your project (or if you don't feel like migrating), you can still pass in your store into ```<Provider />``` with issue.


## addHoney(stateKey, initialState)

Call ```addHoney(stateKey, initialState)``` to create a new piece of state

### Arguments
- **stateKey** *(required)* - unique string. The file/reducer name is recommended for debugging purposes
- **initialState** *(required)* - object that defines the stucture of this piece of your store

### Returns
- **state** - *(object)* - an object containing the methods used to get, set, and reset this piece of state

Example:
```js

import { addHoney } from "redux-honey";

// addHoney() returns a self-contained state object that contains four methods: state.get(), state.set(), state.resetKey(), and state.reset()
const state = addHoney("funWithReduxHoney", {
 loveProgramming: false,
 favLibrary: "redux-honey"
});

// exported to be added passed into the createHoneyPot method
export default state;
```


## state

The returned ```state``` is an object that contains three methods: ```get```, ```set```, and ```reset```.
 
```js

// Gets piece of state
state.get();

// Updates state
state.set();

// Resets key back to its starting value set on initialState that was passed in addHoney
state.resetKey();

// Reset back to the initialState that was passed in addHoney
state.reset();
```

## state.set(payload)

Call ```state.set(payload)``` to set its state

### Arguments
- **payload** *(required)* - object - the object that defines the changes you want to make to your store. You can pass one or more key-value pairs to set your state

### Returns
*null*

Example:

```js
import { addHoney } from "redux-honey";

// addHoney() returns a self-contained state object that contains four methods: state.get(), state.set(), state.resetKey(), and state.reset()
const state = addHoney("funWithReduxHoney", {
 loveProgramming: false,
 favLibrary: ""
});

// exported to be added passed into the createHoneyPot method
export default state;

// updates state's favLibrary and loveProgramming
state.set({ favLibrary: "redux-honey", loveProgramming: true });
```

 
#### Side Note
As a safety check when calling ```state.set()```, your passed payload can't contain key-value pairs that didn't exist on the initialState passed into ```addHoney()```. This prevents you from accidentally mispelling a key. It also prevents you from going all ü§¨ü§¨, breaking your keyboard when you didn't realize you accidentally spelled it ```favLibrarz``` instead of ```favLibrary```. I have unfortunately done this far too many times!

 
```js
// This entire call would fail because isGoingToFailToUpdate was not defined on the initialState
state.set({ favLibrary: "redux-honey", isGoingToFailToUpdate: true });
```
 
 
## state.get(keysString, options)

Call ```state.get(keysString, options)``` to retrieve what you need from its state.

### Arguments
- **keysString** *(optional)* - string - period-separated set of keys. If you want to get the entire state, pass no arguments for ```keysString```
- **options** *(optional)* - object - a set of options when calling ```state.get()```. Options are defined below.

### Returns
- the piece of state that matches the passed keysString

This one is *pretty* neat, so get yo popcorn ready! üçø Here's a quick example:

```js
// An example state structure
{
 name: "John Smith",
 bodyDetails: {
  height: 185,
  weight: 175,
  athletics: {
   athleticLevel: "somewhat",
   sportingAbilities: {
    isGoodAtFootball: false,
    isGoodAtBaseball: false
   }
  }
 }
}

// If I wanted to get the sportingAbilities array, you pass an in-order list of keys like so:
state.get("bodyDetails.athletics.sportingAbilities");
```

It's *that* simple! üéâ 
 
## state.get(keysString, options) -> item from array

This is where ```state.get()``` gets *really* cool. ```state.get()``` can return data for more than just a value for a passed key. It can also retrieve an item from an array in two different ways.

An example to retrieve an item in an array based on index:

```js
import { addHoney } from "redux-honey";

const state = addHoney("funWithReduxHoney", {
 loveProgramming: false,
 favFoods: ["pizza", "chinese", "cookies"]
});

// This returns the item in the array at position 2 as long as it exists
// favFood2 returns "cookies"
const favFood2 = state.get("favFoods.[2]");
```

An example to retrieve an item in an array with a matched key-value pair:

```js
import { addHoney } from "redux-honey";

const state = addHoney("funWithReduxHoney", {
 name: "John Smith",
 friends: [
  {
   id: 21,
   name: "Tom Smith"
  },
  {
   id: 45,
   name: "Johnny Boy"
  },
  {
   id: 92,
   name: "Carl Thompson"
  }
 ]
});

// This returns the item in the array that has an id of 45
// "friend" will be { id: 45, name: "Johnny Boy" }
const friend = state.get("friends.[id=45]");

// This returns null because no object in the friends array has a name "Frank Sinatra"
const emptyFriend = state.get("friends.[name=Frank Sinatra]");
```

Now *that* is pretty freakin cool. ü§ì
 

### Options *(state.get())*

**getItemIndex** - *(optional)* - boolean - defaults to `false`. Set to `true` when calling `state.get()` to receive an item index in an array.
**returnOriginal** - *(optional)* - boolean - defaults to `false`. Set to `true` when calling `state.get()` to recieve a non-cloned version of that piece of state. By default, ```state.get()``` returns a deep-cloned version to allow for easy mutability.

```js
import { addHoney } from "redux-honey";

const state = addHoney("funWithReduxHoney", {
 name: "John Smith",
 friends: [
  {
   id: 21,
   name: "Tom Smith"
  },
  {
   id: 45,
   name: "Johnny Boy"
  },
  {
   id: 92,
   name: "Carl Thompson"
  }
 ]
});

// Returns 0, which is the index of the object in friends with the id = 21
const tomSmithIndex = state.get("friends.[id=21]", { getItemIndex: true });

// Returns an uncloned version of the friend with id = 21
const tomSmith = state.get("friends.[id=21]", { returnOriginal: true });
```

## state.resetKey(key)

### Arguments
- **key** *(required)* - string - a key from your state you would like to reset back to its initial value

### Returns
*null*

Call ```state.resetKey()``` to set a key's value back to its initialState that was passed when calling ```addHoney()```

Example:

```js
import { addHoney, nap } from "redux-honey";


const state = addHoney("funWithReduxHoney", {
 isLoading: false,
 isSaving: false,
 details: {}
});

// exported to be added passed into the createHoneyPot method
export default state;


export const showFunStuffAction = async () => {
  
 const details = { isFun: true };
 state.set({ details });

 // nap() is a method that returns a promise
 // Waits 500ms before continuing. Described in greater detail below
 await nap(500);

 // Resets "details" back to its initial state, which is {}
 state.resetKey("details");
}
``` 

## state.reset(options)

### Arguments
- **options** *(optional)* - object - a set of options when calling ```state.reset()```. Options are defined below.

### Returns
*null*

Call ```state.reset()``` to set the state piece back to the passed initialState passed.

Example:

```js
import { addHoney, nap } from "redux-honey";


// addHoney() returns an object with its reducer and its state object
const state = addHoney("funWithReduxHoney", {
 isLoading: false,
 isSaving: false
});

// exported to be added passed into the createHoneyPot method
export default state;


export const showFunStuffAction = async () => {
	
 // Let components know you're loading data - You know, if you're into that stuff.
 state.set({ isLoading: true });

 // nap() is a method that returns a promise
 // Waits 500ms before continuing. Described in greater detail below
 await nap(500);

 // Resets this piece of state back to what it was when addHoney() was called
 state.reset();
}
```

Super simple!

### Options *(state.reset())*

**keepKeyValues** - *(optional)* - array - This allows you to call ```state.reset()``` but keep current values of certain keys.

```js
const state = addHoney("funWithReduxHoney", {
 isLoading: false,
 isSaving: false,
 favLibrary: "redux-honey",
 name: "Bob Barker"
});


state.set({ name: "Steve Smith", isLoading: true, favLibrary: "" });

// resets state back to its initialState except for "name"
state.reset({ keepKeyValues: ["name"] });
```

## extract(mapHoneyToProps, Component)
A method to bind state to react components. This is very similiar to the react-redux method ```connect()```, but ```extract()``` will throw warnings if you attempt to bind state pieces that don't exist.

### Arguments
- **mapHoneyToProps** *(required)* - function - a function that outlines what state pieces you would like to use to pass as props inside your Component
- **Component** *(required)* - React component

### Returns
An updated component with the passed props from calling the ```extract()``` method

```js
import React from "react";
import { extract } from "redux-honey";

const UserProfile = ({ name, birthDay }) => (
 <div>
  <p>{name}</p>
  <p>{birthDay}</p>
 </div>
)

/*
 user state structure

 user: {
  name: "Steve Smith",
  birthday: "June 19th 1990",
  friends: [],
  favSongs: []
 }
*/

// The method used to determine what state pieces you want passed as props
const mapHoneyToProps = store => ({
 name: store.user.name,
 birthDay: store.user.birthDay
});

export default extract(mapHoneyToProps, UserProfile);
```

To prevent unknown misspelling problems when using extract, redux-honey will throw a warning that something you were asking for doesn't exist on that state:

```js
import React from "react";
import { extract } from "redux-honey";

const UserProfile = ({ name, birthDay }) => (
 <div>
  <p>{name}</p>
  <p>{birthDay}</p>
 </div>
)

/*
 user state structure

 user: {
  name: "Steve Smith",
  birthday: "June 19th 1990",
  friends: [],
  favSongs: []
 }
*/

// This will fail && will throw a warning that the key "friendz" doesn't exist on the user
const mapHoneyToProps = store => ({
 friendz: store.user.friendz
});

export default extract(mapHoneyToProps, UserProfile);
```
 
## nap(duration)

### Arguments
- **duration** *(required)* - number - the number of ms you want to wait until continuing

### Returns
*null*

Call ```nap()``` when you need to block code execution for a defined duration. This is especially useful for animation purposes. An example of it's use is above ‚òùÔ∏è
 
 
## resetStoreToInitialState()

### Arguments
*none*

### Returns
*null*

Call ```resetStoreToInitialState()``` when you need to reset all states in your store back to its initialState. A use case would be after a user signs out.

Example:

```js
import { addHoney, nap, resetStoreToInitialState } from "redux-honey";


// addHoney() returns an object with its reducer and its state object
const state = addHoney("user", {
 name: "Steve Smith",
 isSigningOut: false
});


export const showFunStuffAction = async () => {
	
 state.set({ isSigningOut: true });

 // For fun because why not :)
 await nap(1000);

 // Resets entire store back to all passed initialStates
 resetStoreToInitialState();
}
```
